#### I am currently a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in the School of Computer and Cyber Sciences at **Augusta University**. Prior to this, I was a postdoc research associate in the VADER lab at the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence (SCAI), Arizona State University, working under the guidance of Dr. Ross Maciejewski. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Purdue University, where I was mentored by Dr. David S. Ebert. I received a master's degree in Computer Science from Tufts University in May 2013, under the mentorship of Dr. Remco Chang. My broad research interests include visual analytics, data visualization, human-computer interaction, and applied artificial intelligence and machine learning.

<div class="highlight-box">
  <strong>🎓 Ph.D. Opportunities:</strong> I am actively seeking dedicated and passionate Ph.D. students with research interests in data visualization, HCI, and human-AI trust. If you are driven by curiosity and a desire to innovate in these domains, please reach out.

          <b>MetricsVis: A Visual Analytics System for Evaluating Employee Performance in Public Safety Agencies</b><br/>
          MetricsVis is a visual analytics system that supports multi-attributes and multi-level data exploration. The system is designed for managers and supervisors who want to assess employee performance to improve the productivity of an organization. The users can compare the individual performance by inspecting multiple task categories, as well as aggregation of group performance and organizational performance.

          <b>FeatureExplorer: Interactive Feature Selection and Exploration of Regression Models for Hyperspectral Images</b><br/>
          FeatureExplorer is a visual analytics system that supports the dynamic evaluation of regression models and identification of key features through the interactive selection of features in high-dimensional feature spaces typical of hyperspectral images. We collaborated with remote sensing experts and plant science to predict the plant biomass using hyperspectral features. The interactive system allows domain experts to iteratively refine and diagnose the model by selecting features based on their domain knowledge, interchangeable (correlated) features, feature importance, and the resulting model performance.
